# Icons Used Instead of Images

This application uses icons from the React Icons library instead of image files.

The icons used include:
- FaMoon - For the moon symbol
- FaGift - For the gift icon
- FaKey - For the key/login icon
- FaStar - For decorative elements
- FaCrescent - For the crescent moon logo
- FaLandmark - Used in place of lanterns

No image files are required for the basic functionality of the app.
